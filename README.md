# Maekor-Overpower-Alert
AddOn for WoW Classic 1.13

This addon is for warriors and is an alert to remind the warrior to use Overpower after one of their attacks is dodged.

Type "/moa" in game for a list of commands. Available commands are "/moa unlock", "/moa lock", "/moa reset", and "/moa test".

I do not have access to the beta - so I've been unable to squash all the bugs. But it does work on classic client. You can see Zulp using it in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW_O-m21lUQ&feature=youtu.be&t=195 at 3:15.

<b>TODO:</b>

- <del> hide alert after using overpower</del> done
- alert doesn't consider overpower cooldown (5sec)
